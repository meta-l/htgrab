# htgrab
Takes gnmap file, greps for specified port, curls page, if login page found, stashes IP in file for later analysis

# Version 0.1 - Loops the curl command. Woop-di-fucking-do.
# Version 0.2 - The barely working one. Shoddy as shit, honest.
# Version 0.3 - Error reporting, tidied console/file output. Still shoddy, but kinda functional
# Version 0.4 - Now works for all ports, can set SSL with -s switch. Doesn't suck as much.
# Version 0.5 - Added preference for output file, style tidy, removed global var (thanks to @erickolb)
